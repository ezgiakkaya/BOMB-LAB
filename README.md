# 💣 Bomb Lab Project - COMP201 Fall 2023 💥

Author: Ezgi Akkaya 🌟

## Overview 📚

In this challenging project for COMP201, I tackled the Bomb Lab, a series of exercises that involve disassembling and understanding complex assembly code to defuse a virtual bomb 💻. Each phase of the bomb required a unique approach to disassemble and decipher the underlying logic.

## Phases 🧩

- **Phase 1**: Analyzed `strings_not_equal` function to determine the correct string 🔍.
- **Phase 2**: Dissected the `read_six_numbers` function and determined the required sequence of numbers 🔢.
- **Phase 3**: Implemented conditional logic and memory address calculations to defuse the bomb 💡.
- **Phase 4**: Deciphered a recursive function and determined the correct pair of numbers 🔄.
- **Phase 5**: Cracked a string manipulation puzzle involving bitwise operations and array indexing ✂️.
- **Secret Phase**: Uncovered a hidden phase and solved a complex binary tree traversal problem 🌳.

## Tools and Techniques 🔧

- Utilized GDB for disassembling functions and understanding their flow 🛠️.
- Applied debugging techniques like breakpoints, memory inspection, and register examination 🐞.
- Engaged in reverse engineering to understand the assembly code and its impact on program behavior 🔍.

## Learning Outcomes 🎓

- Gained a deeper understanding of assembly language and machine-level code 📈.
- Developed problem-solving skills in a low-level programming context 🧠.
- Improved debugging and reverse engineering skills 👩‍💻.

## Acknowledgements 🙏

I would like to thank the course instructors and TAs for providing this unique and educational experience.
